# CorreFocsWebPublic
Made for NasaSpaceAppsChallenge 2023.
This is the public version of the webapp that displays CorreFocs balls on a map on Spain.
The rest of the code for this project is here: TODO


### Differences with the demonstration:
- The part that triggers iOS notifications was removed since it uses a library currently in development. (iCmd)
